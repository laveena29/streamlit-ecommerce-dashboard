# streamlit-ecommerce-dashboard
This project is a data visualization dashboard built using Streamlit to analyze fake e-commerce transaction data.

The dashboard allows users to view several metrics and insights, including:
Daily Profit/Loss: A graph that indicates daily profit/loss fluctuations.
Most Popular Products: A bar chart showing the number of orders received or revenue generated in relation to the most popular products.
Filtering: The data can be filtered by product, category, or any other metric.
Potential Fraudulent Orders:A fraudulent order is indicated by using a heuristic in the form of unusual discount orders or low price orders. This project has used fake data for simulating e-commerce transactions.
